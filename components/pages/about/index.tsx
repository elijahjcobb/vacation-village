			<h2>our community</h2>
			<p>{`Vacation Village residents include those who reside with us part-time as well as the whole year, and those people who live and work in the downstate area of Michigan and commute to Elk Rapids on the weekends. Often, residents moor their boats in the nearby harbor and wish to enjoy a convenient, affordable home in a community setting. Although Vacation Village residents hail from all over the United States, the one important thing they have in common is the desire to spend their recreational time celebrating the Northern Michigan experience. Reasons to live the Northern Michigan experience vary amongst our residents. Many people come for sailing, motor-boating or paddling in the harbors of Lake Michigan and Elk Lake; exciting fishing and golf opportunities; many have friends and family in our area and a desire to spend time closer to loved ones; most enjoy being part of a "community" with all the benefits of residing in an area with friends and neighbors valuing the same qualities.`}</p>

The 212-plus-slip harbor is considered one of the best in Michigan.

			<h2>our history</h2>
			<p>{`Vacation Village Mobile Home Park was established in 1967, and has always been a facility for "Seniors". To qualify as a tenant, at least one member of the family must be aged 55 or over. The Park has several unique circumstances complimenting this provision. It is located in an area of relatively high numbers of retirees, and few families with children. Its location on Bass Lake provides a variety of water related activities. In addition, a fine public golf course is across the street. Further, churches, restaurants, food stores, Laundromats, library and medical services are within walking distance. Public transportation is also available.`}</p>
			<p>{`Elk Rapids was platted in 1852 and being the first town in the county of Antrim, Michigan. Elk Rapids was also the county seat until 1879 when the county started to grow and the seat was moved to Keno (now Bellaire, Michigan). Today the county continues to thrive, and Elk Rapids is at the heart of this growth with a complete renovation of the downtown area, a new and expanded marina on Elk Lake and Lake Michigan, and a community spirit that lends itself to the quality of life that residents here are so proud of.`}</p>
